# about puppet
Whats to say about puppet. Not much i guess. Basically three guys playing, fighting, and building. All with good fun. Royal in jokes and always trying to break some borders. 

There is a little origin story that starts with a great man called Nick. Nick is a human you cant find so easily in this world. He knows the good stuff and good stuff knows him. You probably know him under the name Don Monacco di Bavaria. Anyways a few years back he invited me to music contest between local bands. On that night i met Dave aka. T-Dog (later solder-boi). He showed me gpt2 and talked about projects he did with a friend. Dave had studied informatics and was in the middel of finishing his bachelor thesis for powi (yea i know it was not powi but something similar). So we danced that night, intact we danced so good that i had sore muscles from head-banging. Don introduced me to Flo at his birthday party. I was in the middle of an exam prep phase so i decided to focus all my energy on a brainfart i had (something like maps but you are able to search for sun/ sun induced routes). Apparently he had this idea as well and explained to me why it is complicated. I did not listen and continued for a bit bc what does a 10x developer at a party really know? 

Since then we basically met every week and build prototypes. We applied for the SCE incubator and got in with a working AR app called puppet. There we got introduced to the startup-world and found out about pivoting. So about 20 pivots later we applied for an innovation challenge and won with an ai-city-guid app. The next six months we worked with the city of munich and did another round of SCE to spend some more time with Saskia. In the end of the co-creation we got asked to do a workshop at open data day about that open data. 

We stopped to do anything for a bit, except some random maker stuff, hackathons, and game devs. We decided to invest a bit of our award käsch into 3D-Printing. Since then the poor 3d printer has to work a lot. That poor thing has to endure the aud***ass***ity of 3 fools committed to a “test in production” approach. Besides printing nifty stuff from the internet we designed and  build some Lamps. Some may say we faild at that… coming soon though. Anyways as of now we are still doing side-projects and hackathons in between but in generell forget to write down and share that stuff anyway.

This is us trying to change the last point. Hard to say what exactly will happen next but you can expect perfectly curated and fitting blog posts.

Ah if you have money we would take it.
