## Introduction

During the Makerthon organised by FabLab we hacked together a Pixel-Art Mirror. 

We build a LED strip Grid with an ESP and placed it into a frame.

A piCam  connected to a rpi streams the data to the esp. 

All files can be found in this git repo.

The endresult of the project looked like this:

## Requirements

## Bill of Materials

1. 7 meters of WS2812b with 60 leds per meter in total 420 (*noice*) LEDs [link]
2. 1 esp32 (we used a D1 mini with usb c) [link]
3. lots of small wires [link]
4. usb cable (depending on the esp32 you use either usb-c or micro-usb) and plug (or a powerbank if you want to make it mobile)
5. 3 plates of 40cm x 24cm plywood (we used 3mm thickness but it doesn't really matter) [link]
6. 4 cardboards (40cm x 24cm, preferably 3mm thickness)
7. a white cloth thats at least 46cm x 46cm (we used an old bed cover)
8. glue

### Needed Tools

- laser cutter (that can cut your plywood with at least an area of 40cm x 24cm)
- solder iron & zink

### Total cost

#### **35 € - 40 €**

The main cost are the LED strips, we bought them from amazon for 15 € for 5 meters (so 7 meters are ~21 €). 
There are cheaper options available on something like aliexpress though.

An esp32 costs about 7 € (again less on aliexpress) and the wood we used was about 8 € for the 3 plates.

Everything else we had at home, but should be pretty cheap anyway (less than 5 €, if you don't add a powerbank).

## Step 1: Making the frame

## Step 2: Adding some walls

## Step 3: Adding the LED strips

## Step 4: Soldering the LED strips together

## Step 5: Flashing the ESP

## Step 6: Setting up the LED grid

## Step 7: Playing around with some effects

## Extra: Make it a mirror? (maybe take this out for now?)
