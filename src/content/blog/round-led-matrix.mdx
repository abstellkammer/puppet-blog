## Introduction

During the Makerthon organised by FabLab we hacked together a Pixel-Art Mirror. 

We build a LED strip Grid with an ESP and placed it into a frame.

A piCam  connected to a rpi streams the data to the esp. 

All files can be found in this git repo.

The endresult of the project looked like this:

## Requirements

## Step 4: Solder the LED strips together

## Step 5: Flash the ESP

## Step 6: Setup the LED grid

## Extra: Make it a mirror? (maybe take this out for now?)
