## Introduction

A few months ago we - the [puppet team (TM)](/puppet-blog/about) - joined the [fablab neukölln art makerthon](https://luma.com/5jrpyp5u). 
We had 48 hours to make something that should fit in a specified round frame and that we could showcase afterwards.

import frame from "../../assets/posts/round-led-matrix/images/1-frame.png"

<div class="mx-auto max-w-lg not-prose flex flex-col gap-2 py-4">
<Image src={frame} alt="" class="rounded-xl" />
<span class="italic text-sm">
The frame we were given
</span>
</div>

**flo-bit** is a sucker for anything made with controllable RGB LEDs and he can be very convincing when he's passionate 
(and what could possibly worth more passion than individually controllable RGB LEDs?).

So we basically just put a bunch of LEDs into that frame and made a round display. 

Here are a few of the cool effects it can show, curtesy of [WLED](https://kno.wled.ge/).

**This blog post is both the story of how we made it, as well as a how-to guide if you wanna make your own.**

We did initially plan to have this work together with a camera and be a "pixel art" mirror and while we did get this kinda 
working for the demo, for the how-to we'll concentrate on how to make the LED frame with just the effects above (so without the mirror functionality), 
as the mirror part is honestly very hacky and doesn't even look that good imo.

## Requirements

If you plan to try your hand at making one, you need two things apart from the materials:

1. A solder iron (some experience with soldering might be useful, but this is also a good learning project, 
we don't really know how to solder either, we just do it and sometimes it works 😝)

2. A laser cutter that has a cutting area of at least 40cm x 24cm, if you don't have one, check your nearest makerspace

## Bill of Materials

For the materials you need: 
(without the mirror functionality, for that you'd also need a raspberry 3b or above with wifi and a camera). 

(links are to the german amazon, those are not referrer links, just where we bought stuff)

1. 7 meters of WS2812b with 60 leds per meter in total 420 (*noice*) LEDs ([amazon](https://amazon.de/dp/B09N99DJRG))
2. 1 esp32 (we used a D1 mini with usb c) ([amazon](https://amazon.de/dp/B0CJNMRG37))
3. some small wires
4. usb cable (depending on the esp32 you use either usb-c or micro-usb) and plug (or a powerbank if you want to make it mobile)
5. 3 plates of 40cm x 24cm plywood (we used 3mm thickness but it doesn't really matter)
6. 4 cardboards (40cm x 24cm, preferably 3mm thickness)
7. a white cloth thats at least 46cm x 46cm (we used an old bed cover)
8. glue

### Total cost

#### **35 € - 40 €**

The main cost are the LED strips, we bought them from amazon for 15 € for 5 meters (so 7 meters are ~21 €). 
There are cheaper options available on something like aliexpress though.

An esp32 costs about 7 € (again less on aliexpress) and the wood we used was about 8 € for the 3 plates.

Everything else we had at home, but should be pretty cheap anyway (less than 5 €, if you don't add a powerbank).

## Step 1: Making the frame

First we created the backframe, by lasercutting 2 of the plywood plates. Here are the files both for *LightBurn* and as SVGs:

<DownloadFile 
  file={BASE + "/posts/round-led-matrix/files/round-led-matrix-base.zip"}
  title="Base" 
  description="Round base as lightburn and svg version"
/>

Note that there are 2 layers, the first should be cut, the second is just for marking the LED strip positions (so use low power for that one).

The rings for the front were given to us already laser cut, but here are the files for anyone following along at home (from [this fablab github repo](#)).
Use the last plywood plate to cut out the ring segments.

[lasercut file, 1 file svg, 1 file lightburn]

Use some wood glue or just duct tape to glue the parts together and you should have two rings and one big circle with markings on one side for the LEDs 
(you might be able to guess wether we used wood glue or duct tape...)

import base from "../../assets/posts/round-led-matrix/images/3-base.png"


<div class="mx-auto max-w-lg not-prose flex flex-col gap-2 py-4">
<Image src={base} alt="" class="rounded-xl" />
<span class="italic text-sm">
The backside of the base plate.
</span>
</div>

## Step 2: Adding the walls

The walls are also lasercut but out of cardboard (would have taken way to long to cut them out of wood and 
we were in a hurry, you can cut them out of plywood too, but in the end they wont be visible anyway). We just used random packaging 
cardboard we had laying around.

[lasercut files, wall]

Afterwards you can lay them on your base board (good luck figuring out which go where, we don't have a good tip here, we struggled with that too 🙃) 
and start putting them together, we tried that without glue first, but after everything fell apart twice we went for some glue.

import grid from "../../assets/posts/round-led-matrix/images/2-grid.png"


<div class="mx-auto max-w-lg not-prose flex flex-col gap-2 py-4">
<Image src={grid} alt="" class="rounded-xl" />
<span class="italic text-sm">
The cardboard grid.
</span>
</div>

## Step 3: Cutting the LED strips

Now for the first of three steps where you have to pay attention not to fuck it up: 
Cutting the LED strips into segments in with the correct amount of LEDs for each segment.

When cutting also make sure LED strips are cut exactly in the middle of a connection (so you have enough place to solder on both parts).

In total you need:

- **2x** 8 LEDs segments
- **2x** 12 LEDs segments
- **2x** 14 LEDs segments
- **2x** 16 LEDs segments
- **2x** 18 LEDs segments
- **4x** 20 LEDs segments
- **6x** 22 LEDs segments
- **3x** 24 LEDs segments

You can also directly lay them on the board (don't glue them yet though) to make sure you have the correct count,
they should fit perfectly in the little markings on the plate (lengthwise, they are less wide than the markings)

<div class="max-w-lg mx-auto">
:excalidraw[/src/assets/posts/round-led-matrix/drawings/led-count.svg]
</div>

## Step 4: Glueing the LED strips

the LED strips have to be laid out in a serpentine arrangement with the correct count.

<div class="max-w-lg mx-auto">
:excalidraw[/src/assets/posts/round-led-matrix/drawings/led-strips-serpentine.svg]
</div>

there are little arrows on the LED strips that show you the direction there are going, those should alternate go left to right then right to left.


## Step 5: Soldering the LED strips together

Again pay lots of attention here, you can accidentially fry your LED strips if you make a mistake here 
(we've of course *never* fried any LED strip *cough, cough*, thankfully the LED strips are usually sold as 5 meter strips so you have some leftover)

<div class="max-w-lg mx-auto">
:excalidraw[/src/assets/posts/round-led-matrix/drawings/led-strips-serpentine-arrows.svg]
</div>

On each LED strip connection, solder together the 5V, ground and data connection like so:

<div class="w-1/3 mx-auto">
:excalidraw[/src/assets/posts/round-led-matrix/drawings/led-connection.svg]
</div>

In the end you should have something like this:

import gridLeds from "../../assets/posts/round-led-matrix/images/4-grid-leds.png"

<div class="mx-auto max-w-lg not-prose flex flex-col gap-2 py-4">
<Image src={gridLeds} alt="" class="rounded-xl" />
<span class="italic text-sm">
Professionally soldered I would say
</span>
</div>


## Step 6: Flashing the ESP

Take your esp32 and connect it to your computer (be sure to use a cable that has a data connection) and open this website:

:link[https://install.wled.me/]{image="/src/assets/posts/round-led-matrix/screenshots/install.wled.me.png"}

Click on install, select your usb port, confirm and wait a few minutes until it's installed.

Once it's done you'll be asked to enter your Wifi credentials, do that and then click "Open WLED". You should see a screen like this:

import screenMain from "../../assets/posts/round-led-matrix/screenshots/0-screen-main.png"

<div class="mx-auto max-w-lg not-prose flex flex-col gap-2 py-4">
<Image src={screenMain} alt="" class="rounded-xl" />
<span class="italic text-sm">
Main WLED screen.
</span>
</div>

## Step 7: Setup the grid

Click "Config" in the top bar to open the settings page, there click on "2D configuration":

import screenSettings from "../../assets/posts/round-led-matrix/screenshots/1-screen-settings.png"

<div class="mx-auto max-w-lg not-prose flex flex-col gap-2 py-4">
<Image src={screenSettings} alt="" class="rounded-xl" />
<span class="italic text-sm">
WLED settings screen.
</span>
</div>

Check serpentine and enter the dimensions as 24 by 23 LEDs.

import screenMatrix from "../../assets/posts/round-led-matrix/screenshots/2-screen-matrix.png"

<div class="mx-auto max-w-lg not-prose flex flex-col gap-2 py-4">
<Image src={screenMatrix} alt="" class="rounded-xl" />
<span class="italic text-sm">
WLED matrix screen.
</span>
</div>

Scroll all the way down and upload this `gaps.json` file:

<DownloadFile 
  file={BASE + "/posts/round-led-matrix/files/gaps.json"}
  title="gaps.json" 
  description="gap file for WLED 2D settings"
/>

import screenGapsFile from "../../assets/posts/round-led-matrix/screenshots/3-screen-gap-file.png"

<div class="mx-auto max-w-lg not-prose flex flex-col gap-2 py-4">
<Image src={screenGapsFile} alt="" class="rounded-xl" />
<span class="italic text-sm">
Select gaps.json file and click upload
</span>
</div>

Optionally go back to the main page and select a different effect (e.g. rainbow).


## Step 8: Soldering the connection onto the ESP

Last soldering part: solder 5V, ground and data to the beginning of the first LED strip (optionally you can use the 3 pin connectors
that are usually part of the LED strips).

<div class="w-1/2 mx-auto">
:excalidraw[/src/assets/posts/round-led-matrix/drawings/esp32-pinout.svg]
</div>


import gridLedsOn from "../../assets/posts/round-led-matrix/images/5-grid-leds-on.png"

<div class="mx-auto max-w-lg not-prose flex flex-col gap-2 py-4">
<Image src={gridLedsOn} alt="" class="rounded-xl" />
<span class="italic text-sm">
We did actually end up using the 3 pin connectors here.
</span>
</div>


## Step 9: Putting everything together

Ok, we're almost done, lets put everything together:

import gridBaseLeds from "../../assets/posts/round-led-matrix/images/6-grid-base-leds.png"


<div class="mx-auto max-w-lg not-prose flex flex-col gap-2 py-4">
<Image src={gridBaseLeds} alt="" class="rounded-xl" />
<span class="italic text-sm">
Put the grid on top of the base plate, aligning it with the LEDs.
</span>
</div>


import baseBack from "../../assets/posts/round-led-matrix/images/7-base-backside.png"

<div class="mx-auto max-w-lg not-prose flex flex-col gap-2 py-4">
<Image src={baseBack} alt="" class="rounded-xl" />
<span class="italic text-sm">
Optional step: We duct taped the esp32 to the back...
</span>
</div>


import gridBaseFrame from "../../assets/posts/round-led-matrix/images/8-grid-base-frame.png"

<div class="mx-auto max-w-lg not-prose flex flex-col gap-2 py-4">
<Image src={gridBaseFrame} alt="" class="rounded-xl" />
<span class="italic text-sm">
Put the first ring on top of the grid...
</span>
</div>

import gridBaseFrameTape from "../../assets/posts/round-led-matrix/images/9-grid-base-frame-taped.png"


<div class="mx-auto max-w-lg not-prose flex flex-col gap-2 py-4">
<Image src={gridBaseFrameTape} alt="" class="rounded-xl" />
<span class="italic text-sm">
... and duct tape it to the back :D

</span>
</div>

import baseFabricBack from "../../assets/posts/round-led-matrix/images/10-base-fabric-backside.png"


<div class="mx-auto max-w-lg not-prose flex flex-col gap-2 py-4">
<Image src={baseFabricBack} alt="" class="rounded-xl" />
<span class="italic text-sm">
Flip the whole thing around and lay it on top of your fabric.
</span>
</div>

import baseFabricBackTape from "../../assets/posts/round-led-matrix/images/11-base-fabric-backside-taped.png"


<div class="mx-auto max-w-lg not-prose flex flex-col gap-2 py-4">
<Image src={baseFabricBackTape} alt="" class="rounded-xl" />
<span class="italic text-sm">
and more duct tape: Tape the fabric to the backside as well.
</span>
</div>

import homerMeme from "../../assets/posts/round-led-matrix/images/homer-meme.jpg"


<div class="mx-auto max-w-lg not-prose flex flex-col gap-2 py-4">
<Image src={homerMeme} alt="" class="rounded-xl" />
<span class="italic text-sm">
You cares what the backside looks like...
</span>
</div>


import baseFabricFront from "../../assets/posts/round-led-matrix/images/12-base-fabric-front.png"


<div class="mx-auto max-w-lg not-prose flex flex-col gap-2 py-4">
<Image src={baseFabricFront} alt="" class="rounded-xl" />
<span class="italic text-sm">
Flip it around again and glue the second frame on top of the fabric.
</span>
</div>

We somehow forgot to take a picture of that last step, but we're basically done, so it should look something like this:


import cover from "../../assets/posts/round-led-matrix/cover.png"


<div class="mx-auto max-w-lg not-prose flex flex-col gap-2 py-4">
<Image src={cover} alt="" class="rounded-xl" />
<span class="italic text-sm">
So beautiful... This actually shows the "mirror" functionality too, pictured are <b>flo-bit</b> and <b>polijn</b>
</span>
</div>
